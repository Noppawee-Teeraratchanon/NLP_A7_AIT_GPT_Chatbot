Aimed at inspiring inclusion and promoting gender equality, the conference underscored the importance of a gender-sensitive approach in geopolitics, influencing international relations, foreign policy-making, and national politics.\\n\\nAdopting feminist perspectives on war, conflicts, displacements, migration, and peace, the conference set forth three primary objectives: to investigate gendered assumptions in the study of forced migration, examine the implications of militarized notions of territorial citizenship, and explore the practical everyday implications of geopolitics and biopolitics on the causes and consequences of displacements.\\n\\nProf. Kazuo Yamamoto, AIT President, reaffirmed the institute’s unwavering dedication to tackling pressing issues. He highlighted AIT’s over two decades-long collaboration with Canada’s International Development Research Center (IDRC), emphasizing its substantial contributions, particularly in the Gender and Development Studies program. “The IDRC-funded CGFD has played an instrumental role in advancing knowledge and leadership on forced displacement. This international conference serves as a platform for experts from various backgrounds to dissect the intersections of geopolitics, gender, and forced migration, fostering pivotal insights for addressing the challenges faced by displaced communities, especially in South and Southeast Asia,” he added.\\n\\nProf. Paula Banerjee, IDRC Endowed Research Chair and Director of the CGFD reflected on the pandemic’s lesson on global interconnectedness and the pressing need to unite for progress. She emphasized the shift from focusing solely on climate change to addressing ongoing conflicts and displacement, advocating for new solutions, and a collective effort to challenge norms and build a better future.\\n\\nMr. Edgard Rodriguez, Lead (Myanmar) at the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), highlighted the cross-border nature of geopolitics and displacement, calling for a shared responsibility to alleviate suffering. He stressed the importance of the conference discussions in finding practical solutions and steering towards positive change, expressing confidence in the collective effort of IDRC and AIT teams to ensure a brighter, more secure future.\\n\\nAt the inauguration, AIT’s Vice President of Academic Affairs, Professor Nitin Kumar Tripathi, and Professor Kyoko Kusakabe from the Gender and Development Studies of the School of Environment, Resources and Development, shared their insights. Mr. Shawn Patrick Kelly, Executive Director of the Office of International and Public Affairs, underscored the robust collaboration between Canada and AIT, emphasizing its significant contributions to education and research advancements. Professor Ranabir Samaddar, the Distinguished Chair in Migration and Forced Migration Studies at the Calcutta Research Group in Kolkata, India, delivered the keynote address. He delved into the complex issues of migration and displacement, viewed through the prisms of gender and geopolitical changes, offering profound perspectives that enriched the conference’s dialogue.\\n\\nThe conference addressed critical issues, such as the impact of geopolitics on vulnerable populations, particularly women’s marginalization, and the potential for geopolitics to address the situations of Afghans, Rohingyas, and Palestinians from a gender perspective. It also examined the broader effects of geopolitics on private domains and the consequences of toxic geopolitics and noxious masculinity on internally displaced persons (IDPs) and the Stateless, questioning the feasibility of achieving peace and security without gender sensitivities.\\n\\nFeaturing special lectures on myriad aspects of geopolitics, gender, and forced migration and four panels on diverse topics, including internal displacements, citizenship, statelessness, and regional forced displacements, the conference brought together internationally renowned scholars, UN body members, civil society representatives, and students. It concluded with a powerful call to action for participants to challenge norms, foster inclusion, and work toward gender equality in the intricate nexus of geopolitics, gender, and forced migration.\\n\\nShare\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nLinkedin\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nPrint Me\\n\\nYou may also like\\n\\nNewsAIT Students Explore Innovative Construction Techniques at Terra Residence 28 Feb 2024\\n\\nNewsAIT Alumnus Support the Water Engineering and Management Laboratory 27 Feb 2024\\n\\nNewsAIT’s School of Engineering and Technology Hosts Successful Open House 27 Feb 2024\\n\\nNewsAIT and Osotspa Public Co.

Living aquatic resources play a fundamental role in sustaining the livelihoods of many of the rural poor in Asia, providing crucial buffers to shock and food insecurity, and offering opportunities for diverse and flexible forms of income generation. As the world population is expected to reach around 8.6 billion by 2030 and around 10 billion by 2050, FAO estimates that aquaculture should grow by 33% from the level of 76 million tons in 2017 to nearly 103 million tons by 2030, which is 6 million tons more than the capture fishery. The Asia-Pacific region produces almost 90% of the global aquaculture output. Increasing food demands due to rapid population growth will continue to drive aquaculture producers to use more and more intensive methods from accessible land and water areas. Emphasis must therefore be given to more effective use of low-cost technologies including emerging ICTs, innovations, appropriate management practices and securing rights of access and control. This summer training program on Aquaculture Development & Aquatic Resources Management, which will be held in Thailand and coordinated by AIT Extension of Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), is designed for graduate and undergraduate students to uplift their knowledge on sustainable aquaculture production and resilient aquatic resources management practices including innovation and advancements of aquaculture and fisheries industry in South and Southeast Asian Countries. Besides technical input sessions and hands-on training, the program will expose the students to the international and multicultural learning and knowledge environment of AIT, and to the culture and people of Thailand.\\n\\nTraining Contents:\\n\\nAquatic Resources System and Management – principles and practices\\n\\nRecent trends and developments in Aquaculture and Aquatic Resources Management – global perspective with an emphasis on South and Southeast Asia\\n\\nSustainable Aquaculture Planning and Management – case studies on policies adopted in Thailand and other South and Southeast Asian Region\\n\\nCoastal Aquaculture Development and ICZM – emerging practices, issues and strategies\\n\\nSustainable Fisheries Management – interventions from national and international agencies\\n\\nNew Technologies, Tools and Strategies for sustainable, resilient and innovative Aquaculture\\n\\nHands-on session: seed production, nursing, feed and nutrition, and health management in aquaculture and shrimp farming\\n\\nProbiotics in Aquaculture\\n\\nVisit and observe good practices of intensive and sustainable Aquaculture Production\\n\\nExposure to Aquarium Technology and Good Practices\\n\\nExperiential learning on Aquaponics System (growing fish and vegetables together)\\n\\nAquaculture for Rural Development\\n\\nPractical learning on methods and procedures of post-harvest, processing, and value addition of aquatic products\\n\\nDate: 8-19 July 2024\\n\\nVenue: Asian Institute of Technology\\n\\nTraining Fee:\\xa0USD 1,500/- (Inclusive of training-related expenses, excluding accommodation and subsistence allowances)\\n\\nFor more information and registration please visit\\n\\nhttps://extension.ait.ac.th/course/summer-training-program-aquaculture-development-aquatic-resources-management-south-southeast\\n\\nAre you interested in?\\n\\nRegister Here\\n\\nShare\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\nLinkedin\\n\\nEmail\\n\\nPrint Me', metadata={'source': 'html_files\\\\https___ait_ac_th_event_summer-training-program-on-aquaculture-development-aquatic-resources-management-in-south-southeast-asia_.html'}),\n",

As the world population continues to grow, from the current 7.6 billion to 8.6 billion in 2030 and 9.8 billion in 2050, the demand for food and resources is rapidly increasing. This demand poses significant challenges to the agriculture sector, which must produce more food with limited resources, while also addressing the challenges of climate change and environmental sustainability. In response, there has been a growing movement towards smarter, more sustainable, and self-sufficient agriculture practices, utilizing new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Remote sensing and Geographical information systems (RSGIS), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine learning (ML), etc., to improve yields and reduce waste. This summer training program will orient students (undergraduate and graduate), from any background, on viable and efficient strategies for sustainable agriculture through smart and precision farming practices, and the application of cutting-edge technologies and IoT in agricultural sector. The student participants, majoring on or with keen interest in the intersection of ICT, digital transformation, business, and agriculture across the globe, will have ample opportunities to listen and interact with experts from the technology field as well as experts who are applying those technologies in agricultural sector. Lessons learned from demonstrations/field practices and real-world application of technologies will be a vital part of this summer training program. Besides technical input sessions and hands-on training, the summer program will expose the students to the international and multicultural learning and knowledge exchange system at AIT, and to the culture and practices in Thailand.

The research addresses the issues of how human activities and changing climate affect each other and explores the technology and policy options needed for low-carbon development and improving climate resilience for sustainability. Through an interdisciplinary approach taken, AIT research examines greenhouse gas emissions and the impacts of climate change from social, environmental, and technological perceptive. The climate change research theme aims to help determine and support the development of effective solutions with appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies including economic, social, and ecological approaches that are also complementary to other challenges such as Sustainable Development Goals.\\n\\nSub-themes\\n\\nTransition toward Net Zero Emissions\\n\\nClimate Change and Ecosystem\\n\\nEnabling Technology and Innovations\\n\\nSocietal Dimension of Climate Change\\n\\nCities and Climate Change\\n\\nClimate Change Adaptation and Resilience\\n\\nFor details on sub-themes, please see Link.\\n\\nSMART COMMUNITIES\\n\\nDue to rapid urbanization, urban-rural disparity, growing environmental footprint, and inequality, the communities are facings economic, environmental, and social challenges. However, they are also trying to leap-frog through grasping the new opportunities presented by smart technologies, the digital revolution, and the policy innovation that are rapidly emerging to issues facing them. Especially, experiences of smart urban and rural communities are supported by a wide range of information and communication technology (ICT) systems that provide advanced and innovative services to create a positive impact on society that spans all sectors. AIT’s research focuses on the transition to smart communities by leveraging innovative technologies and practices in delivering better economic, social, and environmental outcomes for the community. Within the changing context of smart communities from infrastructure supply-oriented to improving citizens’ quality of life, the research is conducted in a multi- and interdisciplinary way— integrating the different dimensions of development such as technology, environment, socio-economic, and governance.\\n\\nSub-themes\\n\\nEmerging Technologies for Inclusive Development of Rural and Urban communities\\n\\nEcosystem-based Environmental Solutions for Communities\\n\\nDigital Transformation for Economy and Business\\n\\nFor details on sub-themes, please see Link.\\n\\nFOOD-ENERGY-WATER\\n\\nWater, Energy, and Food are vital and critically important to human societies, and their economic and livelihood activities. They are inextricably interrelated to each other and with other societal goals. Global challenges of climate change, ecosystem degradation, intensive economic growth, population growth, and urbanization are increasingly threatening the security and services of WEF systems. With the growing demands of WEF resources driven by these challenges, the social and environmental implications are increasing with unpredictable impacts on livelihoods and the environment. In order to reduce the negative impacts of and across the WEF nexus, effective solutions with integrated low-carbon and multi-sectoral adaptation strategies and policies are needed urgently. To achieve long-term water, energy, and water security, there is also a need to step up the efforts dealing with technology development in addressing the main environmental issues.\\n\\nThe research encompasses the field of each domain of WEF resources, and the nexus approach that considers all three different dimensions recognizing the interdependencies of different resource uses sustainably. The issues covered in relation to WEF sectors include efficiency, equity, resilience, and sustainability, as well as the key questions required to enhance the adoption of technologies and policies to promote the strong synergies of food security, energy, and water investments.\\n\\nSub-themes\\n\\nFood Security\\n\\nSustainable Energy\\n\\nWater Management\\n\\nFood-Energy-Water Nexus\\n\\nFor more details on sub-themes, please see Link.\\n\\nINFRASTRUCTURE\\n\\nInfrastructure systems play a critical role in social and economic activities, and function as critical lifelines for connecting communities, industries, markets, goods, and services as well as for efficient governance. Infrastructure forms the backbone of any social and political development of communities and countries. Hence, investments in infrastructure are increasing rapidly, especially in developing countries to meet the increasing demand for reliable and efficient transportation, power, telecommunication, and water, often termed as the basic services essential for human and social well-being. However, across the world, millions of people are still facing severe absence and shortages of such systems.\\n\\nUnreliable power grids, inadequate water supply, and sanitation systems, and poor transportation networks are still a huge plague in many developing nations. The improvement and resilience of infrastructure systems and services have become vital in the path toward sustainable development and for resilient and prosperous societies. In responding to the future trends and challenges with the rapidly growing communities, it is essential to ensure that the infrastructure systems and facilities are designed with sustainable, resilient, and inclusive approaches. With technology expanding at the rate, it is now, infrastructures need to be flexible to adapt to technological improvements and incorporate better solutions as they become available.\\n\\nAIT’s infrastructure theme represents the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions. That includes transportation systems and networks including roads, bridges, and mass transit; housings, buildings, and facilities; electrical grids, ICTs networks including telecommunications.\\n\\nSub-themes\\n\\nPlanning and Management\\n\\nWater Infrastructure\\n\\nDigital (ICT) Infrastructure\\n\\nFor details on sub-themes, please see Link.\\n\\nTECHNOLOGY, POLICY, AND SOCIETY\\n\\nThe future of economic prosperity and inclusive societal transformation depends on how we address the key societal issues benefiting from emerging innovative technologies and policies. The application of digital technologies, bio-process technologies, environmental technologies, energy technologies, and nanotechnologies holds the greatest potential for competitiveness and sustainable growth in the countries it can be used appropriately. Despite the major technological advancements, the complexity of technologies and the implications they have for many aspects of social life still need to be fully understood and issues of disparity, division, and inequality remain. The understanding of the ongoing digital transformation and consequences of these new and emerging technologies is important to improve individual and societal outcomes, particularly in the face of increasing societal pressures.\\n\\nAIT’s Technology-Policy-Society research theme is cutting-edge research focused on technology development and application, policy innovation, and development and societal issues including the nexus between them. The theme recognizes the growing need of bridging the gap between technology and policymaking which requires an understanding of the policy tools required for modern society and modern technologies. In view of this, the research explores how social science and technology interact with everything from environmental issues to public policies, and a better understanding of the impacts of emerging technologies (artificial intelligence, internet of things, big data, etc.) from societal and policy dimensions while moving forward to inclusive and sustainable development.\\n\\nSub-themes\\n\\nDigital Technology Solutions and Societal Transformation\\n\\nInnovative Policies for Coping with Rapid Transformation taking place in the Region\\n\\nICTs and the Environmental Management\\n\\nEquitable Societal Change and Inclusive Development\\n\\nGender and Forced Displacement\\n\\nFor details on sub-themes, please see Link.\\n\\nResearch\\n\\nResearch Overview\\n\\nResearch Themes\\n\\nResearch Publications\\n\\nResearch Projects\\n\\nKnow Our Researcher', metadata={'source': 'html_files\\\\https___ait_ac_th_research-themes_.html'}),\n",
